# Changelog

## v2.2.2 (2026-02-09)

### Fixed
- **Tweet truncation bug** — `tweet` and `thread` commands now show full tweet text instead of cutting off at 200 characters. Search results still truncate for readability. (h/t @sergeykarayev)

### Added
- **Security section in README** — Documents bearer token exposure risk when running inside AI coding agents with session logging. Includes recommendations for token handling.

## v2.2.1 (2026-02-09)

### Fixed
- **Updated all pricing docs to reflect X API's new pay-per-use model** (launched Feb 6, 2026)
  - Old: Required $200/mo Basic tier subscription — **no longer exists**
  - New: Prepaid credits, pay only for what you use, no subscriptions, no monthly caps
- Added per-resource cost breakdown: $0.005/post read, $0.010/user lookup, $0.010/post create
- Added 24-hour deduplication docs — same post fetched twice in a day = 1 charge
- Added xAI credit bonus tiers (10-20% back as Grok credits at $200+ spend)
- Added usage monitoring endpoint (`GET /2/usage/tweets`) for programmatic cost tracking
- Added Developer Console reference (console.x.com) for credit management, auto-recharge, spending limits
- Added full list of tracked/billable endpoints
- Fixed Limitations section — removed outdated "$200/mo" requirement
- Added full-archive search (enterprise-only) note

## v2.2.0 (2026-02-08)

### Added
- **`--quick` mode** — Smarter, cheaper searches. Single page, auto noise filtering (`-is:retweet -is:reply`), 1hr cache TTL. Designed for fast pulse checks.
- **`--from <username>`** — Shorthand for `from:username` queries. `search "BNKR" --from voidcider` instead of typing the full operator.
- **`--quality` flag** — Filters out low-engagement tweets (≥10 likes). Applied post-fetch since `min_faves` operator isn't available via the API.
- **Cost display on all searches** — Every search now shows estimated API cost: `📊 N tweets read · est. cost ~$X`

### Changed
- README cleaned up — removed duplicate cost section, added Quick Mode and Cost docs
- Cache supports variable TTL (1hr in quick mode, 15min default)

## v2.1.0 (2026-02-08)

### Added
- **`--since` time filter** — search only recent tweets: `--since 1h`, `--since 3h`, `--since 30m`, `--since 1d`
  - Accepts shorthand (`1h`, `30m`, `2d`) or ISO 8601 timestamps
  - Great for monitoring during catalysts or checking what just dropped
- Minutes support (`30m`, `15m`) in addition to hours and days
- Cache keys now include time filter to prevent stale results across different time ranges

## v2.0.0 (2026-02-08)

### Added
- **`x-search.ts` CLI** — Bun script wrapping the X API. No more inline curl/python one-liners.
  - `search` — query with auto noise filtering, engagement sorting, pagination
  - `profile` — recent tweets from any user
  - `thread` — full conversation thread by tweet ID
  - `tweet` — single tweet lookup
  - `watchlist` — manage accounts to monitor, batch-check recent activity
  - `cache clear` — manage result cache
- **`lib/api.ts`** — Typed X API wrapper with search, thread, profile, tweet lookup, engagement filtering, deduplication
- **`lib/cache.ts`** — File-based cache with 15-minute TTL. Avoids re-fetching identical queries.
- **`lib/format.ts`** — Output formatters for Telegram (mobile-friendly) and markdown (research docs)
- **Watchlist system** — `data/watchlist.json` for monitoring accounts. Useful for heartbeat integration.
- **Auto noise filtering** — `-is:retweet` added by default unless already in query
- **Engagement sorting** — `--sort likes|impressions|retweets|recent`
- **Post-hoc filtering** — `--min-likes N` and `--min-impressions N` (since X API Basic tier lacks these operators)
- **Save to file** — `--save` flag auto-saves research to `~/clawd/drafts/`
- **Multiple output formats** — `--json` for raw data, `--markdown` for research docs, default for Telegram

### Changed
- **SKILL.md** rewritten to reference CLI tooling. Research loop instructions preserved and updated.
- **README.md** expanded with full install, setup, usage, and API cost documentation.

### How it compares to v1
- v1 was a prompt-only skill — Claude assembled raw curl commands with inline Python parsers each time
- v2 wraps everything in typed Bun scripts — faster execution, cleaner output, fewer context tokens burned on boilerplate
- Same agentic research loop, same X API, just better tooling underneath

## v1.0.0 (2026-02-08)

### Added
- Initial release
- SKILL.md with agentic research loop (decompose → search → refine → follow threads → deep-dive → synthesize)
- `references/x-api.md` with full X API endpoint reference
- Search operators, pagination, thread following, linked content deep-diving

## v2.1.0 (2026-02-08)

### Added
- **`--since` time filter** — search only recent tweets: `--since 1h`, `--since 3h`, `--since 30m`, `--since 1d`
  - Accepts shorthand (`1h`, `30m`, `2d`) or ISO 8601 timestamps
  - Great for monitoring during catalysts or checking what just dropped
- Minutes support (`30m`, `15m`) in addition to hours and days
- Cache keys now include time filter to prevent stale results across different time ranges
