### Linked Content

External URLs from tweets are in `entities.urls[].expanded_url`. Use WebFetch to deep-dive into linked pages (GitHub READMEs, blog posts, docs, etc.).

### Rate Limits

- 450 requests per 15-minute window (app-level)
- 300 requests per 15-minute window (user-level)

### Cost (Pay-Per-Use — Updated Feb 2026)

X API uses **pay-per-use pricing** with prepaid credits. No subscriptions, no monthly caps.

**Per-resource costs:**
| Resource | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Post read | $0.005 |
| User lookup | $0.010 |
| Post create | $0.010 |

A typical research session: 5 queries × 100 tweets = 500 post reads = ~$2.50.

**24-hour deduplication:** Same post requested multiple times within a UTC day = 1 charge. Re-running the same search within 24h costs significantly less.

**Billing details:**
- Purchase credits upfront at [console.x.com](https://console.x.com)
- Set auto-recharge (trigger amount + threshold) to avoid interruptions
- Set spending limits per billing cycle
- Failed requests are not billed
- Streaming (Filtered Stream): each unique post delivered counts, with 24h dedup

**Usage monitoring endpoint:**
```
GET https://api.x.com/2/usage/tweets
Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN
```
Returns daily post consumption counts per app. Use for budget tracking and alerts.

**xAI credit bonus:**
| Cumulative spend (per cycle) | xAI credit rate |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| $0 – $199 | 0% |
| $200 – $499 | 10% |
| $500 – $999 | 15% |
| $1,000+ | 20% |

Credits are rolling — order/size of purchases doesn't affect total rewards.

**Tracked endpoints (all count toward usage):**
- Post lookup, Recent search, Full-archive search
